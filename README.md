The user is taken through the landing page where he can vote on a quote liking or disliking it. The user can also add quotes that are thereafter voted on.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

You can view the page at https://Turi-byte.github.io/quote/

## Known Bugs

The form must refresh by going to About so it saves a quote. Otherwise adding a second quote will just edit the initial quote.
